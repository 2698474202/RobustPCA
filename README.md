RobustPCA
=========

Robust PCA (Robust Principal Component Analysis) implementation and examples (Matlab).

**Robust PCA** is a matrix factorization method that decomposes the input matrix X into the sum of two matrices L and S, where L is low-rank and S is sparse. This is done by solving the following optimization problem called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP):

\min ||L||_* + \lambda ||S||_1
s.t. L + S = X

where ||.||_* is a nuclear norm, ||.||_1 is L1-norm. For more information on Robust PCA please refer to the original paper "Robust principal component analysis?" Emmanuel J. Cand√®s, Xiaodong Li, Yi Ma and John Wright, 2011. The optimization method is ADMM algorithm (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers).

**Examples:**
  * toy_data: small artificial matrix decomposition.
